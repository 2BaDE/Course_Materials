    "# Using SQL to update a databse \n",
    "\n",
    "We can thinkg of some uses of SQL as \"read-only operations\" and other uses as \"read/write operations\". An example of a \"read-only operation\" is a data analysis on a data dump from some app or research study. An example of \"read/write operations is a software engineer creating the backend for webapp. \n",
    "\n",
    "The write operations are necessary if we're going to use a database to store and update data for an app. **INSERT** is relatively safe, because all it does it add data, but operations like **UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, or ALERT** can be much more dangerous, because they are updating existing data. "

    "\n",
    "Before running : \n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL \n",
    "UPDATE users SET deleted = true WHERE id = 1;\n",

    "SELECT id, deleted FROM users WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using transactions \n",
    "\n",
    "A **transaction** is a sequence of operations treated as a single logical piece of work, and in the world of databases, a transaction must comply to the ACID principles to make sure the operations are processed reliably. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can wrap multiple command in BEGIN TRANSACTION and COMMIT: \n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "BEGIN TRANSACTION;\n",

    "UPDATE people SET wife = \"Winnefer\" WHERE user_id = 2;\n",
    "COMMIT;\n",
    "```\n",

    "If the database is unable to issue both those UPDATE command for some reason, then it will rollback the transaction and leave the databse how it was when it started. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Making backups \n",
    "\n",
    "Most companies make backups of their databases on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis, depending on the size of the database and space available. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Replication \n",
    "\n",
    "A related approach is replication - always storing multiple copies of the databases in different places. However, it is a lot more effort to replicate database and it often means slower performance since write operations have to be performed in all of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Granting privileges \n",
    "\n",
    "Many database systems have users and privileges built into them, because they are stored on a server and accessed by multiple users. As a general rule, there should be only a few users that have full access to the database, since it can be so dangerous. "
