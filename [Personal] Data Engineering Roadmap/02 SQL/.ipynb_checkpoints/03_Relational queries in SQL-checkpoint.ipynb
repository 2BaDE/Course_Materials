    "# 6. More efficient SQL with query planning and optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is a declaritive language - each query declares what we want the SQL engine to do, but it doesn't say how. As it turns out, the how -- the \"plan\" -- is what effects the efficiency of the queries. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.1 Why do SQL queries need a plan? \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 different ways that SQL could find the results : \n",
    "\n",
    "- **FULL Table SCAN** : Look at every single row in the table, return the matching rows. \n",
    "- **Creating an Index** : Make a copy of the table sorted by author, then do a binary search to find the row where the conditions meets. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.2 The lifecycle of a SQL query \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parse** : The query parser makes sure that the query is syntactically correct and semantically correct, and returns errors if not. If it's correct, then it turns it into an algebraric expression and passes it to the next step. \n",
    "2. **Optimize** : The query planner and optimizer does the hard thinking work. If first performs straight forward optimizations. It then considers different \"qeury plans\" which may have different optimizations, estimates the cost (CPU and time) of each query plan based on the number of rows in the relevant tables, then it picks the optimal plan and passes it on to the next step. \n",
    "3. **Execute** : The query executor takes the plan and turns it into operations for the database, returning the results back to us if there are any. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.3 Where do humans come in? \n",
    "\n",
    "Many times, especially for complex queries, there are indeed ways we can help optimize a query, and that's known as **query tuning**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to identify what queries we want to tune, which we can figure out by looking at which of our database calls are taking the longest or using the most resources, like with a SQL profiler. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to understand how a particular SQL engine is executing a query, and all SQL systems come with a way to ask the engine. In SQLite, we can stick **EXPLAIN QUERY PLAIN** in front of any SQL to see what it's doing behind the scenes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now manual optimization to improve that execution plan is needed. If we use index, then the SQL engine would be able to use that index to efficiently find the matching rows. Creating indexes can often make repeated queriers more efficients. "
