    "The study of problems, problem-solving, and the solutions that come out of the problem-solving process. Given a problem, a computer scientist's goal is to develop an **algorithm**, a step-by-step of instructions for solving any instance of problem that might arise. We must be careful to include the fact that some problems may not have a solution. Considering the exception of non-existing solutions, the definition of computer science is the study of problems that are and that are not **computable**(It is also very common to include the word computable when describing problems and solutions)\n",

    "# 5. Why Study Algorithms? \n",
    "\n",
    "Computer scientists learn by experience. We learn by seeing others solve problems and by solving problems by ourselves. Being exposed to different problem-solving techniques and seeing how different algorithms are designed helps us to take on the next challenging problem that we are given. By considering a number of different algorithms, we can begin to develop pattern recognition so that the next time a similar problem arises, we are better able to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we study algorithms, we can learn analysis techinques that allow us to compare and contrast colutions based soley on their own characteristics, not the characteristics of the program or computer used to implement them. It is also important to be able to distiguish between those problems that have solutions, those that do not, and those where solutions exist but require too much time or other resources to work reasonably. \n",
    "\n",
    "As computer scientists, in addition to our ability to solve problems, we will also need to know and understand solution evaluation techniques. In the end, there are often many ways to solve a problem. Finding a solution and then deciding whether it is a good one are tastks that we will do over and over again. "
